Introduction {#intro}
=====================

In a decentralized network containing many [=Data Pod=]s and [=Service Hub=]s, data and
services do not resort in one place, but are intentionally distributed. As a result of
this decentralization, the actors in the network (such as researchers, institutions or service providers), 
need to potentionally involve and communicate with multiple services in order to 
execute a desired business process or workflow. Workflows can be tasks such as the
registration of datasets, the certification of research, publishing in a journal, 
indexing data in a search engine and the archivation of data. Each of these tasks 
can in principle be executed by a dedicated service component. To keep track
of the interactions between [=Artefact=]s (the data) and the [=Service Hub=]s, provenance
trails in the form of [=Artefact Lifecycle Event Log=]s are generated and the actors are
notified about the new events in the network.  To avoid excessive manual work 
by [=Data Pod=] and [=Service Hub=] mantainers, an Orchestrator component is introduced 
in this document to automate part of the required interactions between the actors and 
all other components of the network.

Network actors maintain their data in a [=Data Pod=], which is by design a "passive" component.
The [=Data Pod=] can offer secure data access via Linked Data Platform [[!LDP]] to others, but 
cannot perform actions such as invoking remote services on the network or reading and writing 
network content.  These capabilities are delegated to [=Dashboard=] applications where actors
can manually interact with the [=Data Pod=] and network and [=Orchestrator=]s that can work on 
behalf of actors in an automated way.

On behalf of the actor, an [=Orchestrator=] responds to [=Trigger=]s by executing a number 
of [=Action=]s dictated by a machine-readable [=Policy=]. Possible triggers are incoming 
notifications, perceived changes in [=Artefact=]s, or manual invocation by an actor.
Possible actions are:

-  Sending notifications to other actors; 
-  Requesting access to resources in a [=Data Pod=];
-  Reading data from a [=Data Pod=];
-  Writing or appending data to a [=Data Pod=].

The Orchestrator implements the [=Autonomous Agent=] model: an intelligent software instance 
that operates on an actor's behalf but without any interference of that actor.

In practice, an Orchestrator is dedicated to a single [=Data Pod=] for which it has access 
rights to all relevant resources, including the Linked Data Notification [[!LDN]] [=inbox=]
and the [=Artefact Lifecycle Event Log=].

Its autonomy is supplied by the [=Policy=], which dictates business rules in a declarative manner 
using a [=policy language=].

The remainder of this document specifies the requirements for implementing an [=Orchestrator=] 
component.

High-level overview {#high-level}
=====================

An <dfn export>Orchestrator</dfn> instance is an [=Autonomous Agent=] dedicated to a single [=Data Pod=], [=Service Hub=], or any other actor hosting the [=Artefact Lifecycle Event Log=] and [=Inbox=] resources.
It interprets and executes business rules described in one or more [=Policy=] documents.
The Orchestrator watches the [=Inbox=] for possible triggers, while it records the actions it 
takes in the [=Artefact Lifecycle Event Log=].

## Perspectives

### Data Pod

<pre class='include'>
path: images/high-level.svg
</pre>

From a [=Data Pod=] perspective, a [=Maintainer=] operates the [=Data Pod=] with help of
one or more [=Dashboard=] applications. A Scholarly [=Dashboard=] has the capability to
present the [=Inbox=] and [=Artefact Lifecycle Event Log=] in a human friendly way to the
[=Maintainer=].

When a [=Maintainer=] wants to send a notification to the network, this message is first
sent to the [=Orchestrator=]. With help of [=Policies=],  the [=Orchestrator=] will forward
the notification to an external [=Data Pod=] or [=Service Hub=] and update the 
[=Artefact Lifecycle Event Log=].

The [=Orchestrator=] watches the [=Data Pod=] [=Inbox=] for incoming notifications.

Based on incoming notifications the [=Orchestrator=] executes the [=Policies=] rules that are 
contained in one or more [=Policy=] documents.

Notifications are one type of [=Trigger=] that will start the [=Orchestrator=] executing 
[=Policy=] rules.  See the **Triggers** section to find other types of [=Tiggers=].

There are two main sources of Triggers: 

- Outgoing notifications that are sent by the [=Maintainer=] to the LDN [=Inbox=] of the [=Orchestrator=].
- Incoming notifications that are sent from the network to the LDN [=Inbox=] of the [=Data Pod=]. 

When a trigger arrives, the Data Pod [=Orchestrator=] consults the [=Policy=] documents for zero
or more rules matching the trigger. Each matching rule will result in zero or more [=Actions=].

Basic [=Actions=] can involve reading resources from or sending notifications to [=Service Hubs=] 
or other [=Data Pods=] (including the one it's connected to). In general, an [=Orchestrator=] is free
to implement any kind of local defined [=Action=]. This document will provide the minimum set of 
actions that are shared and supported for all [=Orchestrator=] implementations to support the 
ResearchPod and ErfgoedPod network.

All actions taken by the [=Orchestrator=] are recorded in the Data Pod [=Artefact Lifecycle Event Log=]. 
When the Data Pod [=Orchestrator=] requires manual input from the [=Maintainer=], it can communicate 
this via the LDN [=Inbox=] of the Data Pod. The [=Dashboard=] presents this event 
to the [=Maintainer=] in an actionable way. These actions by the [=Maintainer=] could result 
in a new [=Trigger=].

### Service Hub

<pre class='include'>
path: images/high-level-servicehub.svg
</pre>

From a [=Service Hub=] perspective, a Service Hub [=Orchestrator=] can work on behalf of 
the [=Service Hub=] to establish automated response to notifications from other 
network [=actors=] and [=orchestrators=] in context of the provided service.

As a possible side-effect, it can also actively consult additional [=actors=] in order 
to complete the service.

The Service Hub [=Orchestrator=] responds by delivering a new notification in the [=Inbox=] of the actor that invoked the service.
It is the [=Policy=] that dictates what response to construct and what consecutive [=Actions=] 
(reading resources from or sending notifications to [=Data Pods=] or other [=Service Hubs=]) 
need to be performed.

Also the Service Hub [=Orchestrator=] maintains a Service Hub [=Artefact Lifecycle Event Log=] of all
actions taken on behalf of the [=Service Hub=].

In this way [=Orchestrator=]s mimic the services provided to the [=Data Pod=] and [=Service Hub=].


## Common interaction pattern

<img src="images/high-level-comm.svg" width="900">

A common activity starts when the [=Maintainer=] of a [=Data Pod=] requires a service provided by a [=Service Hub=].
Both [=actors=] can be considered operating an [=Orchestrator=] to automate their participation in the network.
Hence, a common interaction pattern is as follows:

1. The [=maintainer=] at [=Data Pod=] `A` performs an action that affects or interests other actors in the network (eg. adding a new artefact in the data pod).
2. The [=maintainer=] uses the [=Dashboard=] to reflect this action by sending trigger `event A` to the [=Inbox=] of [=Orchestrator=] `A`.
3. This trigger `event A` results in [=Orchestrator=] `A` to take consecutive [=action=]s.
4. [=Orchestrator=] `A` consults its `Policy A` for the received [=trigger=], which, for instance, dictates that it needs to inform the [=Service Hub=] `B` about the event.
5. [=Orchestrator=] `A` sends a notification to `Inbox B` of [=Service Hub=] `B`.
6. The [=Orchestrator=] `B` of the [=Service Hub=] `B` monitors `Inbox B` and is triggered by the new notification in `Inbox B` to take consecutive [=action=]s.
7. [=Orchestrator=] `B` consults its `Policy B` for the received [=trigger=], which, for instance, dictates that the `event A` needs to be appended to the [=Service Hub=] `B` [=Artefact Lifecycle Event Log=].
8. [=Service Hub=] `B` processes the contents of the received notification using an internal process (e.g. manual evaluation the contents, adding metadata, creating a new artefact in the repository). How this is done is not specified.
9. When [=Service Hub=] `B` has completed the process it sends a trigger `event B` to the [=Orchestrator=] `B` to notify the maintainer of [=Data Pod=] A.
10. [=Orchestrator=] `B` consults its `Policy B` which requires not only to send the notification to the `Inbox A` of the [=Data Pod=] `A`, but also to append `event B` to the [=Service Hub=] `B` [=Artefact Lifecycle Event Log=].
11. The [=Orchestrator=] `A` of the [=Data Pod=] `A` monitors `Inbox A` and is triggered by the new notification in `Inbox A` to take consecutive [=action=]s.
12. [=Orchestrator=] `A` consults its `Policy A`, which dictates that the new event should be added to the [=Data Pod=] `A` [=Artefact Lifecycle Event Log=].
13. The [=Dashboard=] displays [=Artefact Lifecycle Event Log=] `A` to the [=maintainer=] of [=Data Pod=] `A` to show that the necessary actions have been taken.

Data Pod Initialization  {#init}
====================

To operate autonomously, an [=Orchestrator=] has to obtain access to some resources 
in the [=Data Pod=], respectively in the [=Service Hub=] (in case the [=Orchestrator=] is working
on behalf of the Service Hub).
These resources are made available in a secure matter to the [=Orchestrator=] using the
[Web Access Control](https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol#web-access-control)
specification. [=Orchestrator=]s that are compliant with the [[solid-protocol#solid-app]] 
Client-Side Implementation requirements can gain access to these resources and manage them on behalf
of the maintainer. 

The following section will use the `acl:` prefix to specify Web Access Control settings.

The minimum setup the [=Data Pod=] (or [=Service Hub=]) MUST have:

- An LDN [=Inbox=] with:
    - `acl:Read` access for the [=Orchestrator=].
    - `acl:Append` access for the [=Orchestrator=] and the Network.
- An [=Artefact Lifecycle Event Log=] with:
    - `acl:Read` access for the [=Orchestrator=] and the Network.
    - `acl:Append` access for the [=Orchestrator=].

The maintainer of the [=Data Pod=] (or [=Service Hub=]) SHOULD have:

- A WebID profile entry for:
    - The location of the LDN [=Inbox=]
    - The location of the [=Artefact Lifecycle Event Log=]
    - The WebId of the [=Orchestrator=]

A [=Data Pod=] MAY have:

- An LDN [=Inbox=] for the [=Orchestrator=] with:
    - `acl:Read` access for the [=Orchestrator=].
- An LDP Container with one or more [=Policy=] rules.

The latter requirements are for use cases where the [=Data Pod=] (or [=Service Hub=]) shares
resources with its [=Orchestrator=].

All actors in the network have a WebId with a profile document that document the web locations 
of the resources they manage.

An example WebId profile of a [=Data Pod=] maintainer can be:

<div class="example">
<pre>
@prefix foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt;.
@prefix solid: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/terms#&gt;.
@prefix as: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#&gt;.
@prefix ldp: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#&gt;.
@prefix ex: &lt;https://www.example.org/&gt;.

&lt;&gt;
    a foaf:PersonalProfileDocument;
    foaf:maker &lt;https://alice.institution.org/profile/card#me&gt;;
    foaf:primaryTopic &lt;https://alice.institution.org/profile/card#me&gt;.

&lt;https://alice.institution.org/profile/card#me&gt;
    foaf:name "Alice";
    ldp:inbox &lt;https://alice.institution.org/inbox/&gt;;
    as:outbox &lt;https://alice.institution.org/lifecycle_events/&gt;;
    ex:orchestrator &lt;https://my.institution.org/orchestrator/profile/card.ttl#me&gt;;
    ex:policies &lt;https://alice.institution.org/policies/&gt;;
    a foaf:Person.
</pre>
</div>

The WebId profile of the [=Orchestrator=] for the [=Data Pod=] above can look like:

<div class="example">
<pre>
@prefix foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt;.
@prefix solid: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/terms#&gt;.
@prefix as: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#&gt;.
@prefix ldp: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#&gt;.
@prefix ex: &lt;https://www.example.org/&gt;.

&lt;&gt;
    a foaf:PersonalProfileDocument;
    foaf:maker &lt;https://my.institution.org/orchestrator/profile/card.ttl#me&gt;;
    foaf:primaryTopic &lt;https://my.institution.org/orchestrator/profile/card.ttl#me&gt;.

&lt;https://my.institution.org/orchestrator/profile/card.ttl#me&gt;
    foaf:name "Alice's Orchestrator";
    ldp:inbox &lt;https://alice.institution.org/orchestrator/inbox/&gt;;
    a foaf:Service.
</pre>
</div>

In the two examples above we have specified:

- An LDN [=Inbox=] for the [=Data Pod=] maintainer `Alice` at: `https://alice.institution.org/inbox/`.
- An [=Artefact Lifecycle Event Log=] for `Alice` at: `https://alice.institution.org/lifecycle_events/`.
- An [=Orchestrator=] for `Alice` defined by: `https://my.institution.org/orchestrator/profile/card.ttl#me`.
- Policies that `Alice` maintains at: `https://alice.institution.org/policies/`.

For the [=Orchestrator=] of `Alice` we specified:

- An LDN [=Inbox=] on the [=Data Pod=] of `Alice` at: `https://alice.institution.org/orchestrator/inbox/`.

Note: In a decentralized network the inbox of the Orchestrator can be at any network location 
and doesn't need to live in the Data Pod of Alice.

For the [=Service Hub=] a similar WebId profile can be created. The decentralized location of all
the [=Inbox=]-s , [=Artefact Lifecycle Event Log=]-s, [=Orchestrator=]-s and [=Policy=] documents can
be discovered by knowing the WebId of all the actors in the network.

An [=Orchestrator=] MAY expose an initialization interface to assist the [=Data Pod=] [=Maintainer=] in 
setting up the required resources, WebId profile and Web Access Control settings.


Rulebook {#rulebook-sec}
=====================

To execute business logic for handling notifications, the [=Orchestrator=] makes use
of one or more [=policy=] documents that are written by the actors in the network.
These policies should be written in a [=policy language=] that the [=Orchestrator=] understands.
In the [Rule language](/spec-rulelanguage/) examples are provided how policies can be
written in a Rule language with possible implementations using \[SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/),
 \[SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) or \[Notation3](https://w3c.github.io/N3/spec/) .

Each policy dictates what should happen when [=trigger=] occurs on behalf of the maintainer of
a [=Data Pod=] or [=Service Hub=]. The [Rule language](/spec-rulelanguage/) provides an 
implementation neutral way to express possible [=policy=] rules. 

In the example below we send a notification to Bob when Alice creates a new artefact.

<div class="example">
<pre>
<b>rule</b> "Notify Bob about new created artefacts"

<b>when</b>

   ?notification a as:Create .

<b>then</b>

   ?notification as:target &lt;http://bob.institution.org/profile/card#me&gt; .

   [ a fno:Execution ;
     fno:executed ex:sendNotification
        ex:notification ?notification
   ] .
</pre>
</div>

When Alice provides this [=policy=] document to her [=Orchestrator=], then each time 
when the [=Orchestrator=] is triggered with an `as:Create` notification , this [=policy=]
will be activated and Bob will receive a copy of the notification. 

In practise, [=policy=] documents can originate from many source and are a composition 
of procedures imposed by:

- personal preferences (ie. defined the maintainer);
- service preferences (ie. the orchestrator works on behalf of a [=Service Hub=]);
- institutional requirements (ie. the employer of the maintainer and the owner of the artefacts);
- domain rules (ie. the broader collaboration context the institution is situated in);
- legislation (ie. the legal obligations);

## Publication of Policies

Policy documents are published as resources in a [=Data Pod=] or [=Service Hub=] LDP Container.
This container can be under the control of the [=Orchestrator=] or a [=Data Pod=]/[=Service Hub=]
maintainer. The WebID profile document of the maintainer SHOULD contain the location of the
policies that should be made available to the orchestrator.

In the Example 1 above, the [=policy=] documents of Alice were made available at the location 
`https://alice.institution.org/policies/`.

The [=Orchestrator=] MUST have `acl:Read` permissions in order to execute the business logic
specified in these documents.

When a [=trigger=] occurs the [=Orchestrator=] will consult all the [=policies=] in the 
supplied locations and follows the instructions.

The [=Orchestrator=] MAY offer only a limited number of [=policy=] execution types to the maintainer.

When a [=policy=] can't be executed due to errors, the [=Orchestrator=] SHOULD send a notification
to the maintainer about this fact.

Triggers {#triggers}
=====================

A <dfn>trigger</dfn> is an event to which an orchestrator can respond by taking [=actions=].
An orchestrator MUST respond to the following four types of triggers:

- a new incoming Linked Data Notification [[!LDN]] in the [=inbox=] of the [=Data Pod=]
    - This inbox should be appendable by the whole network
- a new incoming Linked Data Notification [[!LDN]] in the [=inbox=] of the Orchestrator 
    - This inbox can be private to the Maintainer and Orchestrator
- an observed state changes to watched [=data pod=] resources
- a scheduled trigger from the internal time-based event scheduler

A trigger MUST be identifyable by a [[!URI]], such that the rules written in the [[spec-rulelanguage]] can refer to its occurence.

An [=Orchestrator=] MUST be a compliant [[!LDN]] [Consumer](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/#consumer).
The [=Orchestrator=] MAY advertise multiple inboxes.
In this case, the [=Orchestrator=] MUST retrieve incoming Linked Data Notifications from all advertised inboxes.
Inbox security is discussed in the [security considerations](#security-considerations) sections.

An [=Orchestrator=] SHOULD be able to differentiate between Linked Data Notification sent by the
[=Maintainer=] of the [=Data pod=], a [=Service Hub=] and by the [=Orchestrator=] itself. This
should prevent sending the [=Orchestrator=] in a loop responding to its own triggers.

An [=Orchestrator=] SHOULD have some form data validation of incoming triggers and only respond to  
triggers that correspond to a RDF data shape. Technologies such as \[SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/),
\[https://shex.io/), \[SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) CONSTRUCT or
\[Notation3](https://w3c.github.io/N3/spec/) can be used to validate triggers.

An [=Orchestrator=] MAY have some mechanism in place to validate the origin of the triggers. Technologies
such as [Linked Data Proofs](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/) can be used to sign all 
Linked Data Notifications that are sent over the network, and are validated by the Orchestrator.

An [=Orchestrator=] SHOULD be able to process any notification described in the 
[List of Notifications](https://mellonscholarlycommunication.github.io/spec-notifications/).

An [=Orchestrator=] SHOULD be able to execute one or more [=Policy=] documents that are defined by 
the [=Maintainer=]. An example how [=Policy=] documents can be written is available in the
[Rule language for decentralized business processes](https://mellonscholarlycommunication.github.io/spec-rulelanguage/).

Example of a `Create` trigger using Linked Data Notifications:

<div class="example">

<pre>

POST /orchestrator/inbox HTTP/1.1
Host: alice.institution.org 
Content-Type: application/ld+json;profile="https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams"
Content-Language: en
{
    "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    "id": "urn:uuid:AD02A16E-2F5C-408E-8A4D-D596C6421969",
    "type": "Create",
    "summary": "Alice created an artefact",
    "actor": {
      "id": "https://alice.institution.org/profiles/card#me",
      "type": ["Person"],
      "inbox": "https://alice.institution.org/inbox",
      "name": "Alice"   
    },
    "origin": {
      "id": "https://acme.net/shinyapps/DashBoard123",
      "type": "Application",
      "name": "Dashboard of Alice" 
    },
    "object": "http://alice.institution.org/artefacts/1",
    "published": "2014-09-30T12:34:56Z"
}
</pre>

</div>

Example of a [=Policy=] to forward all `Create` events from `Alice` to `Bob` using 
a [=Policy=] rule:

<div class="example">

<pre>
<b>rule</b> "Forward to Bob"

as:   &lt;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#&gt;
pol:  &lt;https://www.example.org/ns/policy#&gt;
fno:  &lt;https://w3id.org/function/ontology#&gt;
ex:   &lt;https://www.example.org/&gt;
alice:        &lt;https://alice.institution.org/profiles/card#me&gt;
bob:          &lt;https://bob.institution.org/profiles/card#me&gt;
orchestrator: &lt;https://instutition.org/orchestrator/profile/card#me&gt;

<b>when</b>

 ?notification a as:Create  
 ?notification as:actor alice:

<b>then</b>

 ?notifiction as:target bob:

 [ pol:policy  [
      a fno:Execution ;
      fno:executes ex:sendTarget [
        ex:notification ?notification
      ]
   ]
 ]
</pre>

</div>

## Observing resource state changes  ## {#trigger-resource}

Note: PHOCHSTE: This needs some more work to explain how this could work.

An Orchestrator MAY accept resource stage changes of 
[Linked Data Platform Resources](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/#ldpr) as triggers for policy actions.
In this case, the Orchestrator MUST be granted READ-access all observed 
[Linked Data Platform Resources](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/#ldpr).
In the case that an observed [Linked Data Platform Resources](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/#ldpr) 
is also a [Linked Data Platform Container](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/#ldpc), the Orchestrator SHOULD
observe state changes for all [Linked Data Platform Resources](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/#ldpr) 
that are contained by the observed [Linked Data Platform Container](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/#ldpc).
Issue: define something like a trigger description?

## Receving Linked Data Notifications ## {#trigger-ldn}

Sending a Linked Data Notification is the primary way to provoke action from the Orchestrator. 
Common senders of notifications are:
- a [=maintainer=] by using the [=Dashboard=], who performed a manual operation on an artefact (eg. creating a new artefact) and wants to trigger consecutive action (eg. announcing that artefact);
- a [=service hub=] or other [=actor=] who has performed an operation related to an artefact (eg. created a comment about that artefact) stored in the maintainer's data pod and is therefore of potential interest to the orchestrator.

To be able to read the notifications from an [=inbox=],
An orchestrator MUST be a compliant [[LDN#consumer]].
It MAY watch zero or more advertise inboxes, as mentioned in [[#init]] and MUST retrieve incoming Linked Data Notifications from all advertised inboxes.
Inboxes MAY be authenticated according to [[LDN#authenticated-inboxes]], which is discussed further in [[#security-considerations]].

The definitions of all possible [[!LDN]] notifications using the [[!ACTIVITYSTREAMS-VOCABULARY]] are listed in the [[spec-notifications]]. 
An orchestrator MUST at least support the following subset:

- [as:Create](https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Create)
- [as:Announce](https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Announce)
- [as:Update](https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Update)
- [as:Delete](https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Delete)
- [as:Undo](https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Undo)
- [as:Accept](https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Accept)
- [as:Reject](https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Reject)

Issue(8): What notifications do NOT trigger the orchestrator?

When receiving a notification, the orchestrator validates the received notification to 
all notification-based triggers mentioned in its [=policy=]. Technologies such as
[[!SHACL]] and \[SHEX](https://shex.io/)  can be used to validate notifications.

## Scheduled trigger ## {#trigger-schedule}

Note: PHOCHSTE: This needs some more work to explain how this could work.

An Orchestrator MAY accept time scheduled triggers for policy actions.
## Observing resource state changes  ## {#trigger-resource}

An orchestrator can also watch LDP resources ([[[LDP#ldpr]]) (e.g, by means of polling) whose state changes issue a trigger.
Hence, an orchestrator MUST accept resource stage changes of [[LDP#ldpr]] as triggers for rulebook actions.
In case the observed [[[LDP#ldpr]] is also a LDP container ([[LDP#ldpc]]), 
the orchestrator MUST observe state changes for all [[LDP#ldpr]] that are contained by the observed [[LDP#ldpc]].
The Orchestrator MUST request `acl:Read` access all observed [[[LDP#ldpr]] as noted in [[#init]].

At least following state changes MUST issue a trigger:
	- Update of a resource by observing a change in the `Last-Modified` or `ETag` headers.
	- Deletion of a resource by observing a `4XX` status code

Issue: Make resource state changes more concrete: how exactly using HTTP, eg. last modified

In case of an [[LDP#ldpc]], 
the creation or deletion of a container member MUST also issue a trigger.
Thus, the orchestrator SHOULD observe a difference in the set of `?resource` bindings by matching the triple pattern `?container ldp:contains ?resource` on the container's response.


## Scheduled trigger ## {#trigger-schedule}

Finally, some triggers might be configured as recurrent and activate the orchestrator on scheduled intervals.
Therefore, an Orchestrator MUST accept triggers from a time-based job scheduler such as [[cron]]. 

Scheduled trigger can be configured using the crontab; an orchestrator MUST be able to interpret the pattern syntax defined in [[!cron]].
A trigger MUST invoke an action on every matching pattern during the time the trigger is active and the orchestrator is running.

<div class=example>
```
# Issue trigger every weekday morning at 3:15 am

ex:trigger ex:pattern "15 3 * * 1-5"^^ex:crontab
```
</div>

Issue(11): How can you communicate a scheduled trigger from a institutional perspective? for instance, researchers all apply the institutional 

Actions {#actions}
=====================

An <dfn>action</dfn> is a form of interaction with other actors or resources in the network.
An Orchestrator performs such [=actions=] on behalf of a network [=actor=].

There are three types of actions that an orchestrator MUST support:
-  sending Linked Data Notifications [[!LDN]] to an [=inbox=] resource, likely belonging to a [=Service Hub=] or [=Data Pod=].
-  manipulating [[!LDP]] resources of a [=Data Pod=].
-  reading arbitrary [[!HTTP11]] resources

## Sending Linked Data notifications

Sending a Linked Data Notification is the primary way to provoke action from other actors in the network. 
Hence, an orchestrator MUST be a compliant [[LDN#sender]].

From the list of possible [[!LDN]] notifications in [[spec-notifications]],
an orchestrator MUST at least be able to send the following subset:

- [as:Create](https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Create)
- [as:Update](https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Update)
- [as:Delete](https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Delete)
- [as:Announce](https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Announce)
- [as:Accept](https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Accept)
- [as:Offer](https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Offer)
- [as:Reject](https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Reject)
- [as:Undo](https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Undo)

## Reading HTTP resources

A second type of action is reading [[HTTP11]] resources.
Thus, an orchestrator MUST be able to construct a `GET` request.

Issue: does this make sense?

## Manipulating LDP resources

A final action is performing create, read, update and delete operations on a [[LDP#ldpr]] and [[LDP#ldpc]]
Therefore, an Orchestrator MUST be a [[LDP#dfn-ldp-client]] and implement at least the verbs `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`.

Issue: TODO

- Read: `GET`

## Action descriptions

When a rulebook rule executed in response to a [=trigger=], it produces zero or more actions.
Each of these actions is captured in an <dfn>action description</dfn>, which uses a simple vocabulary:

: Class
:: `act:Action`
: Subclasses 
:: `act:NotifyAction` | `act:HTTPAction`
: Properties
:: `act:payload` | `act:target` | `act:description`

This vocabulary MUST be interpretable by the orchestrator and MUST result in an executed action.
The specific requirements are discussed per action type below.

<div class='example'>
```
{
  "@context": "https://mellonscholarlycommunication.github.io/vocabulary/act/context",
  "type": "NotifyAction",
  "description": "Notify service hub of artefact creation.",
  "target": "https://servicehub.org/inbox",
  "payload": {
	  "@type": "as:Create",
	  ...
  }
}
```
</div>

<div class='example'>
```
{
  "@context": "https://mellonscholarlycommunication.github.io/context",
  "type": "HttpAction",
  "description": "Notify service hub of artefact creation.",
  "target": "https://servicehub.org/resource",
  "payload": {
	  "@type": "http:Request", 
	  "http:methodName": "POST",
	  ...
  }
}
```
</div>

Deploying an orchestrator {#deploy}
=====================

An Orchestrator MUST be deployable as a <dfn export>local background process</dfn> or as a <dfn export>remote web service</dfn>.
In case of the latter, an actor SHOULD be able to spawn, initialize and trigger the instance over [[!HTTP11]], as defined in [[#deploy]] and [[#triggers]].
The Orchestrator MAY also serve an [=inbox=] for communicating with third-parties using Linked Data Notifications [[LDN]] .

Example of spawning an orchestrator using Linked Data Notifications:
```

POST /inbox HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Content-Type: application/ld+json;profile="https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams"
Content-Language: en

{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "summary": "Spawn orchestrator",
  "type": "Create",
  "actor": "http://kb.nl#me",
  "object": "http://example.org/orchestrator/1"
}
```

If deployed as a [=local background process=], an (custom) API MUST be present that is able perform these actions.


Security considerations {#security-considerations}
==================================================

## Authenticated Inboxes
In case the Orchestrator supports [triggers from incoming Linked Data Notifications](#trigger-ldn), the Orchestrator SHOULD make use of [authenticated inboxes](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/#authenticated-inboxes) as described by the [Linked Data Notifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/) specification.
Requiring authentication on the pod inbox can prevent unwanted parties from forging notifications to be processed by the Orchestrator.

## Signed notifications
Instead of requiring authentication to post notifications to the pod inbox, the Orchestrator may require notifications to be signed by the sender before accepting notifications.
There was an upcoming panel on signed notifications - TODO
